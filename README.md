# Sub Sinker
This game is a collaboration between myself and FGVel0city for the 2017-2018 SkillsUSA Game Design competition. Combining strategy, stealth, and action, this deceptively difficult game challenges players to balance risk and reward in order to destroy their opponents.

### How to install and run:
Download this repo and open the project in Unity. Then, build it and run the executable it creates.

### How to connect:
Sub Sinker is a LAN Multiplayer game that requires multiple machines connected on a network. Click "Play" on the main menu and on your host machine click "Host". On the same machine, open Command Prommpt and type `ipconfig`. On any other machines, replace the dialog box that reads "localhost" and replace it with the IPv4 address listed in the Command Prompt, then click LAN Client. This should connect the machine to the host.

### Controls:
The controls are simple, but mastering the game is difficult.

WASD: Pilot your sub

Scroll wheel: Change the level your engine is running at (higher levels will reveal more of your surroundings and will increase your speed, while making you more easily spotted)

Left click: Fire a torpedo

Right click: Fire a SONAR ping, illuminating the walls it bounces off

### Gameplay:
Collect health kits (tools) and ammo (torpedos) around the map.

Watch your outer blue ring! Enemies who come within that range can spot your engine.

Jellyfish (currently model-less) can illuminate the game world slightly.

Use the grid in the bottom right to remember the layout of the trenches.

### Debug
Press F1 to self-destruct.

Press F2 to provide global illumination.

Press F4 to regenerate the map (Host only).

Press F6 to reveal the whole map.
